# BasicScenario - Booking system

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/d90j2j97btnaeejk?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ayuscode/basicscenario)

A basic solution implementation for a very simple booking system using:
- ASP .NET Web API
- ASP .NET Identity
- Owin
- Autofaq
- Moq
- Serilog and ELMAH
- Automated build and test using AppVeyor

At the moment UI is intentionally poor (Basic HTML & JS) in master branch in order to separate UI and Backend. 
Added angularjs in angular-js branch.

Future dev in angularjs-ui for a better UI interface.
